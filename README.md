# Valorant Team Analysis and Visualization
In this project, I analyzed the 2022 Valorant Istanbul tournament data using SQL and Tableau. I queried match statistics to assess key factors such as round wins versus losses, average role kill-death ratios (KD), and performance by region. I then developed an interactive dashboard in Tableau that visualized these insights with detailed charts and graphs. This dashboard provided a comprehensive view of trends and strategies that influenced tournament outcomes, offering actionable insights and highlighting areas for improvement and strategic planning.
